In this project, you will use a public data set that’s been loaded into an H2 database to provide a command line interface for users to interact with and edit the data.

As private companies, public organizations, governments at all levels, and municipalities make data available to the public either freely or at a cost, you as a developer have a unique skillset to uncover relationships that otherwise may have gone overlooked. By writing code to quickly sift through millions of database records, you can perform meaningful statistical analyses that provides motivation for further study.

The dataset you’ll be using is a combination of two data sources from World Bank. For each country of the world, two indicators (or measures) are included: the number of internet users per 100 during 2013, and the adult literacy rate in 2013, given as the number of literate adults out of 100. Consult the Project Resources for more information on data collection.

The underlying question that might fuel an initial look into this data could be: is there a relationship between internet usage and adult literacy?
